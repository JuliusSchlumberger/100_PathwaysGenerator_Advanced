    """
    Processes musical actions to create dictionaries for plotting and line drawing.

    Parameters:
    - actions: Dict of action data keyed by composite identifiers including measure and instance.
    - base_y_values: Dict mapping measure identifiers to base y-values.
    - instance_dict: Dict mapping measures to another dict that maps instances to unique numbers.
    - y_offsets: Dict mapping unique instance numbers to y-offsets for vertical positioning.
    - measure_colors: Dict mapping measure identifiers to color strings.

    Returns:
    - action_pairs: Dict for storing Begin and End coordinates by measure and instance.
    - data: Organized list of tuples containing adjusted y-values, markers, colors, and face colors for plotting.
